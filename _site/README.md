Gardens By Design
=================

To see the live demo, go to:

    _site/index.html

The `_site/` folder is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) from the other stuff in this (`.`) folder. The `css/` folder is generated using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) from the `_scss/` folder. Apart from the `_site/` folder, the `css/` folder, the fonts, the jQuery js file, and the images, all the other stuff is hand-written by myself.

A hint to understanding the source (everything outside `_site/`): the DOCTYPE definition is in `_layouts/base.html`, which is a template into which all the `*.html` files under `.` is "rendered".

The write-up for task one (the "documentation" page) is linked to from the footer of the live demo.
